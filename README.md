Objective:

The objective of the game is to stack the blocks on top of each other as they move side to side. To stack a block on top of the blocks below it, you need to stop the block on top of the blocks stacked below (e.g. a 3x3 block right on top of a 3x3 block). If the block is not stopped right on top of each other and there is some overhang , then you will lose the amount of blocks that are hanging over and then will have to stack on top of fewer blocks. If you get down to 0 blocks then the game is over and it will display your score. The goal is to stack the blocks all the way to the top without losing any on the way.


How to play:

Once you compile the file, there will be a block that starts moving back and forth on the bottom row. To stop the block at a certain point, press the navigation switch down. After this another block will appear on the next row.

Once the game ends and the score is displayed, press the reset button on the funkit and make the file again to play again.
